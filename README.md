### Message from Thiago Ferrari  
This is my solution for freeCodeCamp.org's Page View Time Series Visualizer - Data Analysis with Python


This boilerplate brings all the necessary files for running and testing the program.
The file I edited was the "time_series_visualizer.py" where I wrote the python program following the instructions stated on freeCodeCamp.org link mentioned above.  

The file main.py imports the "time_series_visualizer.py" to be excecuted. It also starts the test_module.py - where I could check whether or not I met all of the project's requirements.

Through the analysis of the data set "fcc-forum-pageviews".csv" with Pandas (data cleaning and analysis), I plotted three charts: "line_plot.png" and "bar_plot.png" with Matplolib, and "box_plot.png" with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
